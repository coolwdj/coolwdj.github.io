Now it is easier to submit a contributor licensing agreement (CLA) to Apereo, with online forms, one for each type of agreement, linked from [the licensing page][1].

Contributor agreements allow Apereo to sublicense your contributions to others under flexible terms, including under the open source licenses adopted by the Apereo projects. The Apereo Foundation collects and maintains licensing agreements and grant assignments at the institutional and individual level and [publishes the results publicly][2]. 

With thanks especially to John Lewis and Neal Caidin for the JotForm implementation of these online forms.
