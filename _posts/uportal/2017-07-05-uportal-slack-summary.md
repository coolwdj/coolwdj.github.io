In June 2017, 11 people participated substantially in conversation in the [slack.apereo.org #uportal channel].

+ Aaron Grant
+ Andrew Petro
+ Brandon Powell
+ Christian Cousquer
+ Christian Murphy
+ David Sibley
+ Drew Wills
+ Jim Helwig
+ Marissa Warner-Wu
+ Matt Clare
+ Tim Vertein


Conversation highlights include:

+ Aaron Grant's [uportal_commit_stats] script and findings about uPortal contributions. [gitinspector] might also be useful for uPortal-related Git history analysis.
+ Internationalization of documentation stored in Git. What Symfony does in its [primary][symfony-docs] and [French-translation][symfony-docs-fr] documentation. (Separate repos.). Alternatively, the [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin] . Example [ReactJS portlet with i18n support] based in [i18next].
+ Sharing resources from the Open Apereo 2017 conference, including [Portal?! uPortal! What is this Béchamel], [Speeding up uPortal with ReactJS], [two-hard-problems]. (Cf. [uportal-dev@ thread re conference artifacts].)
+ Encouraging interest in the new [Accessibility group]. (Cf. [Accessibility Across Apereo thread on uportal-user@])
+ [styled-components] for styling React.js apps, [browser support for Polymer].
+ [conversational UI example]
+ Weather API options, including World Weather Online, Weather Underground, weather.gov, DarkSky API.
+ The [@uPortal] Twitter account.
+ The role of some CSS classes ` <xsl:attribute name="class">up-portlet-control focus externalLink</xsl:attribute>` (turns out to be used in some JavaScript associated with the maximize menu option).
+ uPortal 5 [fanciness for setting up Tomcat][uPortal-start PR 6] and [deployment via Gradle][uPortal-start PR 8]. [Renaming the overlays directory][uPortal-start PR 10] (cf. [uportal-dev@ thread on overlays directory renaming] or [another][another uportal-dev@ thread on overlays directory renaming]).
+ [myday cloud-based portal]
+ [sonar][sonarwhal], a linting tool for the web



## On Slack

I have [concerns about the openness properties of Slack as implemented by Apereo][open@ 2017-06-15]. You can't access it or read its logs anonymously; it's not Google search indexed. Only the most recent ten thousand messages are available, so in practice this means logs are unavailable older than about a month back.

Summarizing the conversations in this anonymously, publicly accessible and Google indexable context somewhat mitigates these problems. But not necessarily other problems that make [email list communications preferable in open source projects].

Arguably, all of the conversations held in the `#uportal` Slack channel this month could have been held via email on `uportal-dev@` or `uportal-user@` email lists additionally or instead. Some relevant email list threads are linked above.
