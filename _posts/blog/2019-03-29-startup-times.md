- Hello?
- Startup Times Hotline where trying is the first step to failure. How may I help you?
- I am an enterprise application developer, working for an enterprise business aiming to urgently improve the state of our enterprise...and maybe yours. Not sure. I'll have to check with the enterprise.
- What is this inquiry about?
- I have excellent news. After many many months of trial and error and an unbelievable demonstration of human perseverance, we have managed to urgently reduce the start-up time of our enterprise application significantly. Isn't this the sort of thing your institution writes articles about?
- Absolutely! How significant of a significance are we talking about here?
- The startup-time of the old version was around `35` seconds, and now through hulkish feats of solid engineering, we are looking at a startup-time of about `30` seconds.
- So, `5` seconds?
- I am not sure I appreciate your tone here. `5` seconds is a looooong time. If you were on your deathbed, wouldn't you want to have `5` seconds more with your loved ones? Of course you would! Note that we used to restart the application almost on a daily basis. This is a life savings of almost one minute a week.
- Uh...OK...which means?
- Exactly. It means after a couple of hundred years, this effort would start to save lives and reunite families. Do you now understand the significance of this improvement?
- Sure, very impressive. Would you like to come in for a ...?
- Sorry. Hold on one second...I am getting a text from my enterprise architect...Oh...wait...I am being told we would be retiring the application in  the very near future and we are being acquired by an enterprise solution.
- Sorry to hear that. I hope the adoption and transition process goes smoothly?
- Yeah, but usually these things take a long time.
- Like...`5` seconds long or...? Hello? Hello?!
