The official CAS `5.3.0` GA was released on [June 29th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.3.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.0.0`. Note that this is a **major release** of the CAS software which *may* present significant changes in architecture, configuration or behavior. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release.

This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **second** release candidate in the `6.0.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/08/03/600rc1-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.0.0-RC2
```

### New & Noteworthy

#### JDK 10

Work continues to ensure CAS can support and build on top of JDK 11. At this time, a number of supporting libraries that handle code generation, test coverage
and static analysis are not quite ready for JDK 11, and a few more foundational frameworks such as Spring and Spring Boot have yet to be upgraded to a release friendly 
to JDK 11. In this release, the JDK requirement continues to stay at `10` with the _hopes_ that said core components would be ready for JDK 11 around the time of 
the next release candidate.

Note that this release candidate builds on top of Spring framework `5.1` and Spring Boot `2.1`. The upgrade should provide improvements for CAS startup time and be ready in anticipation of the upcoming JDK `11` release.

#### WAR Overlay

The Maven WAR overlay template is now deprecated and moved aside. The reference overlay project simply resides [here](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) and is transformed to use the Gradle build tool instead. This is done to reduce maintenance overhead and simplify the deployment strategy while allowing future attempts to make auto-generation of the overlay as comfortable as possible.

#### OAuth2 UMA

A first pass at OAuth2 User-Managed Access is [now available](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/OAuth-UMA-Protocol.html). This is very much a rough take
and will require some fine-tuning and tweaking in future iterations to fully make it spec-compliant and functional.

#### Authentication Source Selection

In the event that there is more than one (primary) authentication source defined, CAS is given the ability to present the user with a choice in the login screen
to select the appropriate credential source before authenticating. This capability can also be automated using credential predicates if a pattern can formulated and linked
to a specific authentication source. This variation here is the less-automated way of selecting an authentication source, taking into account user input directly.

#### Forgot Username

The _Forgot your username?_ scenario is now supported by the CAS password management facility.

#### OAuth2 Token Management

Specific endpoints are provided as part of [CAS monitoring toolkit](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Monitoring-Statistics.html) 
to manage and revoke OAuth2 access and refresh tokens. 

#### Hazelcast Discovery Strategies

CAS is now able to take advantage of Kubernetes for [Hazelcast auto discovery of nodes](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Hazelcast-Ticket-Registry.html). Support for discovery strategies based on Docker Swarm is also included and available.

### Small Stuff

- Expired registered service definitions are now blocked by CAS as always, but are not strictly modified in the service registry as disabled services.
- A ton of improvements to the Travis CI integration tests to ensure performance and compliance. This area continues to improve.
- Release of authentication-level attributes, typically those related to protocols or those captured by metadata populators is now controlled via a central policy.
- Generation of [CAS configuration metadata](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Metadata-Repository.html) is massaged to take into account enumerations and nested inner classes.
- [Delegated authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) now attempts to check for SSO status before handing off the request to a provider.
- REST API authentication using X509 is now capable of TLS client authentication.
- [Delegated authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) gains the ability to use path variables for client names instead of query parameters, for identity providers such as Azure.
- CAS documentation integrates with Angolia for its search capabilities.
- [SAML2 support in CAS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html) begins to support encrypted attributes as well as name ids.
- Minor bug fixes to database schema handling, log messages, MFA context validation, ticket serialization, and OATH validations.
- CAS [OpenID Connect support](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/OIDC-Protocol.html) gains a better handle on logout and session management.
- OAuth2 grant type selection is now enforced for relying parties, etc.
- [Kryo for memcached](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Memcached-Ticket-Registry.html) continues to auto-register a few more components, specially with CAS has turned on MFA or delegated authentication.
- [Session replication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Webflow-Customization-Sessions.html#jdbc-session-replication) can now be done using a JDBC backend.
- [Yaml Service Registry](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/YAML-Service-Management.html) is able to recognize both `.yml` and `.yaml` files.
- [Delegated authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) to SAML identity providers gains a few bug fixes when resolving SP or IdP metadata over URLs. The service provider metadata generated by CAS can now optionally be signed using metadata signing keys.
