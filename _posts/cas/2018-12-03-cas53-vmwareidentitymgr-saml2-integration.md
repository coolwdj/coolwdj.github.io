VMware Identity Manager is identity management for the mobile cloud era that delivers on consumer-simple expectations like one-touch access to nearly any app, from any device, optimized with AirWatch Conditional Access. As a SAML2 service provider, VMware Identity Manager can be integrated with CAS running as a SAML identity provider and this blog post provides a quick walkthrough of how to make that integration possible.

Our starting position is based on the following:

- CAS `5.3.x`
- Java 8
- [Maven Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) (The `5.3` branch specifically)

# VMware Identity Manager Configuration

- Register CAS as an identity provider

- Configure authentication methods

# CAS Configuration

First, ensure that your CAS deployment is equipped to act as a [SAML2 identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html). Next, you may also use the [JSON Service Registry](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/installation/JSON-Service-Management.html) to keep track of the VMware Identity Manager relying-party registration record in JSON definition files.

The JSON file to contain the VMware Identity Manager registration record would be as follows:

```json
{
  @class: org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService
  serviceId: your-vmware-idm-entity-id
  name: VMware Identity Manager
  id: 1
  description: VMware Identity Manager
  attributeReleasePolicy:
  {
    @class: org.apereo.cas.services.ReturnMappedAttributeReleasePolicy
    allowedAttributes:
    [
      @class: java.util.TreeMap
      givenName: [ java.util.ArrayList [ firstName ] ]
      mail: [ java.util.ArrayList [ email ] ]
      sAMAccountName: [ java.util.ArrayList [ userName ] ]
      sn: [ java.util.ArrayList [ lastName ] ]
      userPrincipalName: [ java.util.ArrayList [ userPrincipalName ] ]
    ]
  }
  metadataLocation: /path/to/vmware-idm.xml
  signAssertions: true
  skipGeneratingSubjectConfirmationNotBefore: true
  signResponses: true
}
```

A few things to point out:

- You will of course need to adjust the `serviceId` and `metadataLocation` to match your data and VMware Identity Manager instance.
- Make sure CAS has retrieved the allowed attributes (i.e. `mail`, `givenName`, etc) listed in the JSON definition file.

# Finale

Thanks to Keith Conger of Colorado College who was kind enough to share the above integration notes. If you too have an integration with a well-known SAML2 service provider, please consider sharing that guide in form of a blog post here as well.
