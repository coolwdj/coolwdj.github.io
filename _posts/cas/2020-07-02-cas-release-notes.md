Apereo CAS release notes will no longer be published on this blog. Instead, they have moved over to the CAS official site and will be available at [https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/release_notes](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/release_notes/Overview.html). This change will be effective for CAS `6.3.x` and all other upcoming versions.
