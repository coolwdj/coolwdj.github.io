The official CAS `6.1.0` GA was released in [October 2019](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases). Since then, the project has been moving forward with the development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.2.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **second** release candidate in the `6.2.0` series.

If you are looking for additional info on the previous release candidate, [please see this post](https://apereo.github.io/2019/11/29/620rc1-release/).

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership) and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed *almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support, maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will ensure support for the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and the CAS project at that, runs and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to be a critical part of the identity and access management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

### Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

## Resources

- [Documentation](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/)
- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
cas.version=6.2.0-RC2
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>There are no changes to the minimum system/platform requirements for this release.
</div>

## New & Noteworthy

### CAS Overlay

The [CAS overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) is updated to use Gradle `6`. The most notable difference is that dependencies in the build
are now recommended to use the `implementation` syntax instead of the `compile` configuration, which is set to be removed in Gradle `7`.  The CAS documentation is
also modified to reflect this change for the appropriate CAS versions. While this is not a breaking change (yet), you should begin to use and 
prefer the `implementation` syntax to avoid surprises in the future and reduce build warnings. 

### Okta Authentication

CAS is now able to validate credentials and fetch user attributes [from Okta](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Okta-Authentication.html).

### LDAP Password Management

[LDAP Password Management](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/password_management/Password-Management-LDAP.html) is now given the ability
to support multiple LDAP servers to locate and update accounts or to fetch security questions.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br />This is a breaking change. Consult the CAS documentation 
  and adjust your settings accordingly to refer to <code>cas.authn.pm.ldap[0]</code> instead.
</div>

### Ehcache v3 Ticket Registry

The [Ehcache integration](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ticketing/Ehcache-Ticket-Registry.html) is now updated to present support for Ehcache v3.
The integration with Ehcache v2 is now deprecated and scheduled to be removed at a future date.

Likewise, cache-based operations for X.509 authentication are also updated to use Ehcache v3.

### Configuration Unknown Fields

The `ignoreUnknownFields = false` flag from CAS configuration validation has been removed in favor of Spring configuration metadata. This field is deprecated
by the Spring Boot framework and will be eventually removed. We are taking preemptive action to stay compatible with future upgrades
of Spring Boot, and also provide a more pleasant experience as far as migration of CAS properties is concerned, 
with reports on deprecations, replacements, etc on startup.

### Configuration Validation

Configuration properties are automatically validated on CAS startup to report issues with configuration binding,
specially if defined CAS settings cannot be recognized or validated by the configuration schema. 

### Azure Active Directory Authentication

Following up on the [previous release candidate](https://apereo.github.io/2019/11/29/620rc1-release/), the Azure Active Directory integration 
is now moved to [a standalone module](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Azure-ActiveDirectory-Authentication.html) that is 
capable of both authenticating users using Azure Active Directory and fetching attributes separately
as an independent attribute repository.

### Ldaptive v2 Upgrade

This release candidate bumps the ldaptive library version to `2.0.0-RC1`, which brings forward the following changes to impact CAS settings:

- `useSSL` property removed; LDAPS scheme is used to specify SSL.
- `providerClass` property removed.
- `DEFAULT` connection strategy is removed.
- `attributeValue` setting replaces `attributeValues` for LDAP validators. 

We are hoping to get test feedback before the final release of the ldaptive library, which will most likely
ship with subsequent releases candidates. To provide feedback, please look for support options on the 
[ldaptive website](https://www.ldaptive.org/).

### Surrogate Authentication via REST

[Surrogate Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Surrogate-Authentication.html) can now be activated
and used as part of [CAS REST protocol](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html).

### Multifactor Authentication via YubiKey

[Multifactor authentication with Yubikey](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/YubiKey-Authentication.html) is now enhanced
to be able to handle multiple devices per user account.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br />This is a breaking change as the internal data structures used to track YubiKey device registrations
  are now modified to handle multiple device records. 
</div>

### Authentication Handler Resolution

[Resolution of authentication handlers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Authentication-Components.html) can now
be done using Groovy scripts to further narrow down the collection of candidate authentication handlers for transactions dynamically.

### LDAP Acceptable Usage Policy

[Acceptable Usage Policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/webflow/Webflow-Customization-AUP.html) backed by LDAP is now given the ability
to support multiple LDAP servers to locate and update accounts with the results of the policy acceptance submission.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br />This is a breaking change. Consult the CAS documentation 
  and adjust your settings accordingly to refer to <code>cas.acceptable-usage-policy.ldap[0]</code> instead.
</div>

### YubiKey Device Storage via Redis

[YubiKey Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/YubiKey-Authentication.html) can now
manage device registrations inside a Redis database.

## Other Stuff

- Better test coverage for components that automate Spring Webflow configuration.
- Code cleanup and better maintenance of the codebase using an upgraded version of the error-prone compiler.
- Minor fixes to OAuth functionality in handling conditions that decide whether refresh tokens should be issued.
- Various documentation improvements and typo fixes.
- Managing U2F devices via Groovy is given the ability to monitor and watch the Groovy script.
- Auto-configuration of multifactor trusted devices is now fixed to properly activate and configure the webflow when enabled.
- OAuth PKCE flows receive a fix to correctly calculate hashes for code verifications when using `S256` as the hash algorithm.
- Several improvements to the distributed session store, when handling delegated authentication to external identity providers.
- Annotation processing is turned on for Splunk and CloudWatch logging facilities to ensure CAS appenders are recognized in logging configurations.
