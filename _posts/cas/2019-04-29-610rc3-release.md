The official CAS `6.0.0` GA was released on [December 28th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v6.0.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with the development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.1.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **third** release candidate in the `6.1.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2019/03/01/610rc2-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay
{:.no_toc}

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.1.0-RC3
```

## Changes

{:toc}

### New & Noteworthy

#### OAuth `id_token` Response Type

CAS acting as an [OAuth identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html) gains support for `id_token` as a new response type.

#### OpenID Connect Response Mode

CAS acting as an [OpenID Connect provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html) is now able to support the `response_mode` parameter.

#### Principal Attribute Repositories 

[Principal attribute repositories](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Caching.html) assigned to a service definition can now narrow down the collection of attribute repositories to fetch attributes at release time. The [attribute resolution engine](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Resolution.html) backed by Person Directory is also tweaked to allow for additional filtering mechanisms.

#### GNU `libc crypt(3)` Password Encoding

Support for password encoding using a `crypt(3)` compatible way has been added through a special `GLIBC_CRYPT` encoder type.

#### Duo Security Account Status Endpoint

A new actuator endpoint for [Duo Security](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/DuoSecurity-Authentication.html) to 
fetch and report back on user account status.

#### SAML2 Attribute Friendly Names

Attribute friendly names put into the [SAML2 response](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html) can now be defined globally first, and then overridden on a per-service basis. 

#### Ticket Expiration Policy per Service

Service and proxy ticket [expiration policies](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ticketing/Configuring-Ticket-Expiration-Policy.html) can optionally be decided on a per-service basis.

#### SAML2 Service Providers

The list of supported [SAML2 Service Providers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-SAML-SP-Integrations.html) continues to grow
with new additions such as ArmsSoftware, Academic HealthPlans, etc.

#### Google Analytics Cookies

Integration with [Google Analytics](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-Google-Analytics.html) is extracted into its own module which *MUST* be included in the overlay to activate the functionality. CAS also presents the ability to drop in a special cookie upon successful authentication events to be later process and consumed by Google Analytics. The value of this cookie is determined as a principal/authentication attribute.

#### Existing SSO Sessions & UI

Additional user interface work is done to detect existing a single sign-on session for a user and display modest warnings, in the event that
re-authentication is being forced.

#### JavaMelody Monitoring

Integration with [JavaMelody Monitoring](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/monitoring/Configuring-Monitoring-JavaMelody.html) 
is now provided out of the box.

#### SSO Participation per Service

SSO Participation of applications can now be controlled conditionally 
on a [per-service basis](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SSO-Session-Cookie.html).

#### Google Authenticator w/ Redis

Multifactor authentication with [Google Authenticator](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/GoogleAuthenticator-Authentication.html)
gains support for Redis as a storage option to manage tokens and accounts/devices.

#### OAuth & OpenID Connect Sessions

[OAuth](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html) and/or [OpenID Connect](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/OIDC-Protocol.html) features in CAS should no longer have to rely on HTTP sessions and container session replication in clustered deployments. 

### Other Stuff

- Allow the OAuth `profile` endpoint to accept and produce claims and attributes with non-primitive complex object types.
- Additional options to let CAS URL-decode authentication requests for relevant SAML2 profiles when running as a SAML2 identity provider.
- A collection of *new* object types (i.e. attribute release policies, etc) are now registered with Kryo to prevent serialization issues with Memcached.
- Additional logging and instrumentation for throttled authentication attempts and expiration policies.
- Preserve parameters in the CAS authentication flow, if the initial request to the `/login` endpoint is done via a `POST`. 
- Ensure all ticket types are recognized during object serialization for MongoDb and CouchDB ticket registries.
- The caching strategy for principal attribute repositories is redesigned as a standalone Spring bean.
- Registration of CAS views rendered upon service validation is redesigned and refactored internally.
- Incremental improvements to delegated authentication to remove reliance on HTTP sessions.
- Minor adjustments to ticket-granting ticket expiration policy based on throttled timeouts.
- Dynamic construction of Hazelcast-backed maps can now specify their merging strategy when dealing with duplication.
- Registration of CAS SSO participation strategies is redesigned and refactored internally.
- Core components from the WS-Federation STS module are broken down and extracted into an `api` module for better extensibility. 
- Core components from the reports module are broken down and extracted into an `api` module for better extensibility.
- Fetching dynamic metadata via MDQ should no longer require explicit entity ids in the SAML service definition. 
- Incremental improvements to delegated authentication so it can work correctly in concert with multifactor authentication.
