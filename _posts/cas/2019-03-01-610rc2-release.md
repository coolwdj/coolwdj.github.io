The official CAS `6.0.0` GA was released on [December 28th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v6.0.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.1.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **second** release candidate in the `6.1.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2019/02/01/610rc1-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay
{:.no_toc}

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.1.0-RC2
```

### New & Noteworthy

#### SAML2 Attribute Value Types

Attribute values put into a SAML2 response can now carry specific type information if necessary on a per-service basis. Complex attribute values that are formatted as POJO objects are conditionally serialized into their XML representation using Jackson's `XmlMapper`. 

[See this](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html#saml-services) for more info.

#### OAuth2 JWT Access Tokens

OAuth or OpenID Connect Access tokens can now be [produced as JWTs](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html) on a per-service basis.

#### Groovy Acceptable Usage Policy

Handling [acceptable usage policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/webflow/Webflow-Customization-AUP.html) decisions can now be managed using a Groovy script.

#### OpenID Connect WebFinger 

Support for OpenID Connect WebFinger Issuer Discovery [is now available](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html).

#### Cassandra Ticket Registry

As yet another storage option, CAS tickets can now be stored 
in [Apache Cassandra](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ticketing/Cassandra-Ticket-Registry.html). 

#### Redis Audit Manager

As yet another storage option, CAS audit logs can now be stored in [Redis](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Audits.html). 

#### Custom Login Fields

The CAS login form/view can now accept and bind dynamic [custom fields](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ux/User-Interface-Customization-Views.html) to the authentication process where fields are made available to authentication handlers for additional processing. 

#### Cassandra Service Registry

As yet another storage option, CAS registered service definitions can now be stored 
in [Apache Cassandra](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/services/Cassandra-Service-Management.html). 
 
### Other Stuff

- Small improvements affect multifactor authentication bypass during validation events.
- Health indicators, that report status to the `health` actuator endpoint, can be conditionally enabled via CAS settings.
- The process of publishing and releasing CAS has switched to use the `maven-publishing` Gradle plugin.
- The `status` actuator endpoint is able to operate partially without the presence of the `health` actuator endpoint.
- Fixes to OAuth2 claim release, honoring the attribute release policy for relying parties.
- Continued effort to ensure CAS unit/integration tests are upgraded to use the JUnit 5 framework.
- Minor documentation fixes regarding Redis-related properties.
- OAuth2 scopes in the access token response produced by CAS are now flattened to be more friendly to most OAuth2 clients.
- Hazelcast ticket registry bug fix related to object serialization when impersonation is turned on.
- Small fixes related to triggering multifactor authentication based on principal attributes.
- Attribute release policies for OpenID Connect relying parties can operate without a defined scope.
- Adjustments to dependency management to ensure the CAS overlay and the command-line shell remain functional.
- CAS audit managers may only record a selection of audit actions, configured in CAS settings.
- A number of bug fixes that improve management and handling of impersonation session expiration policies.
- Audit logs for OAuth user profile requests attempt to record client identifiers and recipients better. 
- A new actuator endpoint is available to report back on the availability of [Duo Security](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/DuoSecurity-Authentication.html) using its `ping` API.
