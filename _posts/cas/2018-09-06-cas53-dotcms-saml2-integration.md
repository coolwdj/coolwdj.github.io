dotCMS is an open source content management system (CMS) written in Java for managing content and content-driven sites and applications. As a SAML2 service provider, dotCMS can be integrated with CAS running as a SAML identity provider and this blog post provides a quick walkthrough of how to make that integration possible.

Our starting position is based on the following:

- CAS `5.3.x`
- Java 8
- [Maven Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) (The `5.3` branch specifically)

# Configuration

First, ensure that your CAS deployment is equipped to act as a [SAML2 identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html). Next, you may also use the [JSON Service Registry](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/installation/JSON-Service-Management.html) to keep track of the dotCMS relying-party registration record in JSON definition files.

The JSON file to contain the dotCMS registration record would be as follows:

```json
{
  @class: org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService
  serviceId: your-dotcms-entity-id
  name: dotCMS
  id: 1
  description: dotCMS Content Mangement System
  attributeReleasePolicy:
  {
    @class: org.apereo.cas.services.ReturnAllowedAttributeReleasePolicy
    attributeFilter:
    {
      @class: org.apereo.cas.services.support.RegisteredServiceMutantRegexAttributeFilter
      patterns:
      {
        @class: java.util.LinkedHashMap
        memberOf: (?<=CN=)([^,]+)->$1
      }
    }
    allowedAttributes:
    [
      java.util.ArrayList
      [
        mail
        givenName
        memberOf
        sn
      ]
    ]
  }
  metadataLocation: https://path.to.your.dotcmscloud.com/dotsaml/metadata/3dd4ad1e-e2ab-492e-a428-87af35d341fd
  signAssertions: true
  skipGeneratingSubjectConfirmationNotBefore: true
  signResponses: true
}
```

A few things to point out:

- You will of course need to adjust the `serviceId` and `metadataLocation` to match your data and dotCMS instance.
- Make sure the `AssertionConsumerService` endpoint in the dotCMS metadata contains the `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect` binding.
- Make sure CAS has retrieved the allowed attributes (i.e. `mail`, `givenName`, etc) listed in the JSON definition file.
- Regarding the `memberOf` attribute, the values fetched from the directory are typically in the format of `CN=WebAdmin,OU=something,OU=something,DC=somewhere,DC=edu`. The service provider requires only the `CN` portion of the attribute value where CAS would need to produce `<saml2:AttributeValue>WebAdmin</saml2:AttributeValue>` instead of `<saml2:AttributeValue>CN=WebAdmin,OU=something,OU=something,DC=somewhere,DC=edu</saml2:AttributeValue>`. This bit is handled via the `RegisteredServiceMutantRegexAttributeFilter` element in the JSON file.

# Finale

Thanks to Keith Conger of Colorado College who was kind enough to share the above integration notes. If you too have an integration with a well-known SAML2 service provider, please consider sharing that guide in form of a blog post here as well.
