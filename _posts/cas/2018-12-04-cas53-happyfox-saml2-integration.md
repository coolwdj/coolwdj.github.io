HappyFox is an all-in-one help desk ticketing system. As a SAML2 service provider, HappyFox can be integrated with CAS running as a SAML identity provider and this blog post provides a quick walkthrough of how to make that integration possible.

Our starting position is based on the following:

- CAS `5.3.x`
- Java 8
- [Maven Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) (The `5.3` branch specifically)

# HappyFox Configuration

Use [these instructions](https://support.happyfox.com/kb/article/515-using-saml-for-single-sign-on/) to set up HappyFox as a SAML2 service provider.

# CAS Configuration

First, ensure that your CAS deployment is equipped to act as a [SAML2 identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html). Next, you may also use the [JSON Service Registry](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/installation/JSON-Service-Management.html) to keep track of the HappyFox relying-party registration record in JSON definition files.

The JSON file to contain the service provider relying-party record would be as follows:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "https://[name].happyfox.com/saml/metadata/",
  "name" : "HappyFox",
  "description": "HappyFox",
  "id" : 1,
  "evaluationOrder" : 1,
  "metadataLocation" : "file:/etc/cas/config/saml/happyfox-metadata.xml",
  "usernameAttributeProvider" : {
    "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.PrincipalAttributeRegisteredServiceUsernameProvider",
    "usernameAttribute" : "mail"
  }
}
```

Note that HappyFox does not provide its own SP metadata and you will have to create it youself. The following is example of what that metadata may look like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata"
                     validUntil="2050-12-05T19:27:46Z"
                     cacheDuration="PT604800S"
                     entityID="https://[name].happyfox.com/saml/metadata/">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor AuthnRequestsSigned="false" WantAssertionsSigned="false"
                        protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol">
        <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat>
        <md:AssertionConsumerService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
                                     Location="https://[name].happyfox.com/saml/callback/"
                                     index="0" />
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
</md:EntityDescriptor>
```

A few things to point out:

- You will need to adjust the `serviceId` and `metadataLocation` to match your data and the HappyFox instance.
- Make sure CAS has retrieved the allowed attributes (i.e. `mail` etc) listed in the JSON definition file. This is required in the final generated SAML2 response to create the proper `NameIDFormat` element.
- Make sure the SP metadata has the correct entity id, matching your HappyFox instance address.

# Finale

If you too have an integration with a well-known SAML2 service provider, please consider sharing that guide in form of a blog post here as well.
